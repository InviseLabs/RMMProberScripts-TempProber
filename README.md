# RMMProberScripts-TempProber
A small Windows command-line tool which outputs all temperature sensor data detected, along with a PASS or FAIL if temps are too high. Some sensors are faulty so check output before turning on alerts inside your RMM dashboard. Works with any RMM dashboard or IT Admin software.
